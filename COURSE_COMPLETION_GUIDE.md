# üéØ System Design Course Completion Guide

Congratulations on completing the comprehensive System Design Course! Here's your roadmap to mastering system design interviews at major tech companies.

## üìö Course Summary

You've covered:
- **Module 1**: Fundamentals (Scalability, Reliability, Performance, Consistency, CAP Theorem)
- **Module 2**: System Components (Databases, Caching, Message Queues, CDN, Microservices)
- **Module 3**: Design Patterns & Principles (Architectural patterns, Trade-offs, Capacity planning)
- **Module 4**: Case Studies (Twitter, Netflix, Uber, WhatsApp - Real-world systems)
- **Module 5**: Interview Preparation (RADIO framework, Common questions, Communication strategies)
- **Module 6**: Practical Exercises (Beginner to Advanced practice problems)

## üéì Next Steps for Interview Success

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Practice Daily**: Solve 1 system design problem daily using RADIO framework
2. **Mock Interviews**: Schedule 2-3 mock interviews with peers or mentors
3. **Company Research**: Study your target company's engineering blog and tech stack
4. **Weak Area Focus**: Identify and strengthen your weakest areas

### Interview Preparation (2-4 weeks before interviews)
1. **Intensive Practice**: 2-3 hours daily of focused practice
2. **Company-Specific Questions**: Practice questions commonly asked by your target companies
3. **Communication Skills**: Record yourself explaining system designs
4. **Time Management**: Practice with strict time limits

### Final Week Before Interviews
1. **Light Review**: Review key concepts without intensive practice
2. **Rest and Relaxation**: Get good sleep and manage stress
3. **Company Research**: Final review of company culture and values
4. **Confidence Building**: Review your successful practice sessions
