## PowerPoint Presentation Script & Visual Guide

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** The Zen of Angular Optimization: A Lighthouse-Guided Journey
**Subtitle:** From 4.5MB bundles to blazing-fast load times
**Presenter:** [Your Name]
**Date:** [Current Date]

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Gradient from dark blue to light blue
- Angular logo (top left)
- Lighthouse icon (top right)
- Performance speedometer graphic (center)
- Animated loading bars showing improvement

**Presenter Notes:** 
- Start with the "3 seconds" hook
- Make eye contact with audience
- Pause for dramatic effect after the hook

---

## Slide 2: The Problem - The 3-Second Rule
**Title:** 3 Seconds. That's All You Have.

**Visual Elements:**
- Large countdown timer animation (3, 2, 1)
- Split screen showing:
  - Left: Current app loading (slow, spinning wheel)
  - Right: Optimized app loading (fast, smooth)
- Statistics callout boxes:
  - "53% of users abandon if load > 3 seconds"
  - "4.47 MB initial bundle"
  - "Performance Score: 45/100"

**Key Points:**
- Performance isn't just about speed—it's about accessibility
- Every millisecond counts for volunteer engagement
- Current state: 4.47 MB bundle, 15-20 second load on 3G

**Presenter Notes:** 
- Don't shame the current state
- Frame as "opportunity for improvement"
- Use hand gestures to emphasize the 3-second countdown

## Slide 3: Understanding Lighthouse Metrics
**Title:** What Lighthouse Really Measures

**Visual Elements:**
- Timeline diagram showing FCP, LCP, TTI, CLS
- Interactive timeline with hover effects
- Color-coded metrics:
  - FCP: Green (when users see something)
  - LCP: Blue (when they see what matters)
  - TTI: Orange (when they can do something)
  - CLS: Red (page stability)

**Key Metrics Explained:**
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** When users see *something*
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** When they see *what matters*
- **TTI (Time to Interactive):** When they can *do something*
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Whether the page is stable

**Presenter Notes:**
- Use hand gestures to show timeline progression
- Emphasize that Lighthouse measures user experience, not just speed

---

## Slide 4: Our Optimization Approach
**Title:** Measure → Analyze → Optimize

**Visual Elements:**
- Three-step process diagram with arrows
- Icons for each step:
  - Measure: Lighthouse CI icon
  - Analyze: Magnifying glass with bundle analyzer
  - Optimize: Gear with performance improvements
- Circular flow diagram showing continuous improvement

**Process Steps:**
1. **Measure** → Lighthouse CI baseline
2. **Analyze** → Bundle analysis & bottleneck identification
3. **Optimize** → Targeted interventions

**Presenter Notes:**
- "No optimization without measurement"
- "We use Lighthouse CI to make performance a first-class citizen"

## Slide 5: Quick Win #1 - Lazy Loading Deep Dive
**Title:** Lazy Loading: Load Only What You Need

**Visual Elements:**
- Before/after code comparison (split screen)
- Bundle size reduction animation
- Network waterfall diagram showing reduced initial load
- Code syntax highlighting

**The Change:**
```typescript
// Before: Eager loading
import { CommitteeFormBuilderComponent } from './committee-form-builder';

// After: Route-level lazy loading
{
  path: 'CommitteeFormBuilder/:id',
  loadChildren: () => import('./features/committee-builder.module')
    .then(m => m.CommitteeBuilderModule)
}
```

**Impact:**
- Initial bundle reduced by ~792KB (Staff + Volunteer)
- TTI improved by ~2-3 seconds

**Presenter Notes:**
- "We've already started this journey—now we finish it"
- Show the dramatic bundle size reduction

---

## Slide 6: Quick Win #2 - OnPush Change Detection
**Title:** OnPush: Smarter Change Detection

**Visual Elements:**
- Angular change detection tree diagram
- Animation showing OnPush vs Default detection
- CPU usage graph showing reduction
- Component tree visualization

**The Problem:**
Every HTTP request triggers change detection across the entire component tree

**The Solution:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-dashboard',
  templateUrl: './dashboard.component.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
```

**Impact:**
- 40-60% reduction in change detection cycles
- TTI improvement: ~1-2 seconds

**Presenter Notes:**
- "Not every component needs this—start with leaf components"
- Show the dramatic reduction in CPU usage

---

## Slide 7: Quick Win #3 - Font Loading Strategy
**Title:** Async Font Loading: Don't Block the Critical Path

**Visual Elements:**
- Network waterfall showing blocking vs non-blocking fonts
- Font loading timeline comparison
- Before/after FCP improvement chart
- Google Fonts logo with loading animation

**Current Problem:**
```html
<!-- These block rendering! -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Optimized Approach:**
```html
<!-- Preconnect to speed up DNS/TCP/TLS -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

<!-- Async load with font-display: swap -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

**Impact:**
- FCP improvement of 400-800ms
- Better perceived performance

imports: [
  MatDialogModule, MatProgressSpinnerModule, MatIconModule,
  MatCardModule, MatDatepickerModule, MatFormFieldModule,
  // ... 20 more modules
]
```

**Optimized Approach:**
Feature-specific imports only

**Impact:**
